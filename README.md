OpcUa-IndustrialGateway
A C++ project developed to learn and demonstrate industrial data communication between OPC UA and MQTT.

Goal
The goal of this gateway is to collect data from industrial servers (OT) and make it available for modern web or cloud applications (IT). It is a practical study in building stable, high-performance bridges for the industrial sector.

Features
OPC UA Integration: Built using the open62541 library to connect to industrial PLCs/Controllers.

Edge Logic: Basic processing of data before it is sent further.

Modern C++: Focused on clean code, memory management, and object-oriented design.

Technical Details
Language: C++

Libraries: open62541 (OPC UA), vcpkg (Package Manager).

Target Environment: Industrial automation
